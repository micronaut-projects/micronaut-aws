== @IntentHandler removal
`@IntentHandler` annotation has been removed. `@IntentHandler` helped to implement automatically the method `canHandle` of an Alexa's handler.
If you had code, such as `@IntentHandler("HelloWorldIntent")`, you need to implement `canHandle` method. For example:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public boolean canHandle(HandlerInput handlerInput) {
return handlerInput.matches(Predicates.intentName("HelloWorldIntent"));
}
----

== micronaut-aws-route53 removal

Module `micronaut-aws-route53` which used AWS SDK V1 has been removed. Instead, you can use `micronaut-aws-service-discovery` module which provides the same functionality but it uses AWS SDK V2.
