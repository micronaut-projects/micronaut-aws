The `micronaut-function-aws-alexa` module includes support for building Alexa Skills with Micronaut:

dependency:micronaut-function-aws-alexa[groupId="io.micronaut.aws"]

TIP: In Micronaut 1.1 or above you can create an Alexa Skills application with `mn create-function hello-alexa --provider alexa`

When using Micronaut's Alexa support you set your Lambda handler name to api:function.aws.alexa.AlexaFunction[] class or a sublcass of this class if you plan to customize it.

The api:function.aws.alexa.AlexaFunction[] will wire up your Alexa application and supports dependency injection of the following types:

* `com.amazon.ask.dispatcher.request.handler.RequestHandler`
* `com.amazon.ask.dispatcher.request.interceptor.RequestInterceptor`
* `com.amazon.ask.dispatcher.request.interceptor.ResponseInterceptor`
* `com.amazon.ask.dispatcher.exception.ExceptionHandler`
* `com.amazon.ask.builder.SkillBuilder`

Simply declaring these types as beans will automatically configure the Alexa Skill appropriately.

To set the skill ID of your skill to enable skill verification, set the following property in Micronaut (application.yml or environment variable)
under the property name 'alexa.myskillname.skill-id'.

TIP: You can find sample applications in Java, Kotlin and Groovy in the https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-aws/tree/master/examples[Examples] directory of the repository.
