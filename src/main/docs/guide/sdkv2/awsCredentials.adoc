By default, AWS SDK v2 will attempt to find AWS credentials from the following places:

1. Java system properties: `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretAccessKey`.
2. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
3. The default credential profiles file: `~/.aws/credentials`.
4. Amazon ECS container credentials, loaded from Amazon ECS if the environment variable
`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is set.
5. Instance profile credentials, used on Amazon EC2 instances, and delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service.

For more information, check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html[the AWS documentation].

If you still want to specify the credentials via configuration, you can do so in the application configuration file:

[configuration]
----
aws:
  accessKeyId: your_access_key_id_here
  secretKey: your_secret_key_id_here
  sessionToken: your_session_token_here
----
