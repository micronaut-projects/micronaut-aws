By default, Micronaut application will try to create the group and stream for you using AWS client. To disable this behavior you have to set the `createGroupAndStream` flag to `false` inside your appender.
Default value for group name is your application name and for stream name is your hostname. If you want you can change them by setting value `groupName` for group name and `streamName` for stream name.
