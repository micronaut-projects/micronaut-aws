Since the list of services offered by AWS is huge, you can write your own client support and leverage the foundation
classes that support the services supported by Micronaut.

To do so, you would create a `@Factory` class that would get injected by some other beans to do its job along with a
`io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.service.ServiceClientConfigurationProperties` class that will be plugged into the
factory to allow for custom and inherited configuration values

For example, to create a client for AWS Rekognition:

Create a `io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.service.ServiceClientConfigurationProperties` class:

snippet::io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.RekognitionConfigurationProperties[tags="class", project="aws-sdk-v2", source="test"]

Then create the client factory:

snippet::io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.RekognitionClientFactory[tags="class", project="aws-sdk-v2", source="test"]

<1> This method needs to be implemented so that the parent factory class knows how to create the builder. You may apply
    additional customisations to the builder here.
<2> This method gives a chance to register a `BeanCreaterEventListener` over the builder, so that any builder can be
    customised. Needs to be overridden to apply the `@Singleton` annotation.
<3> This method builds the client. Needs to be overridden to apply the `@Bean` annotation.
