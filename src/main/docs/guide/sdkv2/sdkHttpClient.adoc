By default, the AWS SDK v2 will pull transitively both the Netty (async) and Apache HTTP (sync) clients. If you wish
to use a client based on the JVM's lightweight `URLConnection`, you should configure it as explained below.

NOTE: To use distributed configuration features, such as AWS Secrets Manager, you need to load `SdkHttpClient` at bootstrap. Set `aws.sdk-http-client.bootstrap` to `true` at `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml`.
