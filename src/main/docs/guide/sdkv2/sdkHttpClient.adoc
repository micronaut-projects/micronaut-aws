By default, the AWS SDK v2 will pull transitively both the Netty (async) and Apache HTTP (sync) clients. If you wish
to use a client based on the JVM's lightweight `URLConnection`, you should configure it as explained below.

NOTE: Micronaut will set the `User-Agent` header for all clients as `micronaut/<version>`. You can change this by adding a `@Singleton` and `@Primary` bean that implements `io.micronaut.aws.ua.UserAgentProvider`.
