Micronaut provides a high-level, uniform object storage API that works across the major cloud providers: https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-object-storage/latest/guide/[Micronaut Object Storage].

If you still need the low-level AWS S3 client, add the following dependency:

dependency:s3[groupId="software.amazon.awssdk"]

Then, the following beans will be created:

* `software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3ClientBuilder`
* `software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client`.

And:

* `software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3AsyncClientBuilder`
* `software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3AsyncClient`.

The HTTP client, credentials and region will be configured as per described in the <<sdkv2, SDK v2 documentation>>.

Additionally, this service accepts the following configuration properties:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.service.s3.S3ConfigurationProperties.adoc[]
