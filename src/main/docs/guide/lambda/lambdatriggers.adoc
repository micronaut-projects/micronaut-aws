https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html[AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services] to invoke functions. The Micronaut application type you select depends on the triggers you want to support. To respond to incoming HTTP requests (e.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html[AWS Lambda Proxy integrations in API Gateway]) you can choose either `Application` or `Serverless Function`. For other triggers, such as consuming events from a queue, or run on a schedule you will choose `Serverless Function`.

|===
| Application Type
| Trigger type
| `Application` or `Serverless Function`
| HTTP requests to a single endpoint
| `Application`
| HTTP requests to multiple endpoints
| `Serverless Function`
| S3 events, events for a queue, schedule triggers etc.
|===

On the one hand, if you need to support a single endpoint a `Serverless Function` gives you a function with less code (which translates to a faster cold startup).

On the other hand, functions written as an application of type `Application` allows you to code with a more familiar paradigm - Classes annotated with  `@Controller`. That it is possible because, through the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.micronaut.aws/micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy[micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy] dependency, Micronaut integrates with the https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-java-container[AWS Serverless Java Container] project.

NOTE: `micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy` supports only https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html#http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.proxy-format[Payload format version 1.0].
