To smooth the developer experience, when you use the `micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy` dependency, Micronaut AWS offers the `micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy-test` dependency.

Add it as a `developmentOnly` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy-test[groupId="io.micronaut.aws",scope="developmentOnly"]

and to the test classpath:


dependency:micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy-test[groupId="io.micronaut.aws",scope="test"]

This dependency starts a Jetty server, allowing you to have the same developer experience (run the app while developing or test it with `@MicronautTest`) as when you use a  runtime such as Netty.
