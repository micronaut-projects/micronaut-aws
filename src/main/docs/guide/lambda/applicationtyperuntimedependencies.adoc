https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.micronaut.aws/micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy[micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy] has a transitive dependency to https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.micronaut.aws/micronaut-function-aws[micronaut-function-aws].

The previous set of artifacts have a group id of `io.micronaut.aws`.

Micronaut CLI or Launch will include the necessary dependencies when you select the `aws-lambda` feature or both `aws-lambda` and `graalvm` features.
