https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] is a universal virtual machine which allows to compile Java programs to https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native executables].

The introduction of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html[AWS Lambda custom runtimes] enables cold startup improvements for Java applications running in AWS Lambda.

> A runtime is a program that runs a Lambda function's handler method when the function is invoked. You can include a runtime in your function's deployment package in the form of an executable file named bootstrap

Micronaut's dependency https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.micronaut.aws/micronaut-function-aws-custom-runtime[micronaut-function-aws-custom-runtime] eases the creation of AWS Lambda Custom runtime to execute a Micronaut function.

The main API you will interact with is api:function.aws.runtime.AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime[]. An abstract class which you can extend to create your custom runtime `mainClass`. That class includes the necessary code to perform the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build[Processing Tasks] described in the Custom Runtime documentation.

When you generate a project with Micronaut CLI or https://launch.micronaut.io[Micronaut Launch] with `aws-lambda` and `graalvm` features, the output includes the necessary files to generate a ZIP file to distribute your functions as a GraalVM Native Image executed from a AWS Lambda custom runtime.
