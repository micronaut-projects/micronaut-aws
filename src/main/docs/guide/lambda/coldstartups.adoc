Instances of Lambdas are added and removed dynamically.
When a new instance handles its first request, the response time increases, which is called a cold start. After that request is processed, the instance stays alive (â‰ˆ10 m) to be reused for subsequent requests.

Lambdas execution have different phases (Initialization, Invocation...).

During the initialization phase:

- AWS Lambda starts a JVM.
- Java runtime loads and initializes handler class.
- Lambda calls the handler method.

The intialization phase has access to more CPU because of that Micronaut starts the application context and eagerly inits singletons during the intialization of the handler class.
